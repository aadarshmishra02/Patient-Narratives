# Patient-Narratives
Narratives about patientsâ€™ experiences with health care contain a wealth of information
about what is important to patients and are valuable in contextualizing and improving patient
experience. Patients provide narrative descriptions of their experiences in a range of settings,
including online communities, patient portals, and consumer rating sites. Here we focus on
narratives collected from patients using standardized open-ended questions that appear on
systematically sampled patient experience surveys.

Patient narratives can be considered a conduit through which nurses are able to gain greater insight into the world of their patients. They support empathic behaviours, encourage shared learning,  and open up a plethora of opportunities to ensure the delivery of high quality, person-centred care.

The Named Entity Recognition (NER) process involves identifying and categorizing key information within the clinical narrative. The Extracted Entities section provides a concise summary of the identified entities, offering a clear overview of the significant terms and phrases present in the text.
